I am currently creating a Nuxt version of this project, so that I can scale it in the future.</p></div><div id="portfolio-main-content" class="g-flex-column"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="744f029cad6daeeeab99.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Design</h3><p>Trying to find a different way to present my portfolio pages, I took inspiration from an unlikely place: the Chrome DevTools Performance tab. I thought it would be interesting to try integrate this in some way, which ended up being in the nav bar.</p><p>I had also wanted to use this opportunity of a portfolio site to experiment with page transitions, that I do not typically get to do with client projects. I am very pleased with how the transitions turned out, and how smoothly they work.</p><p>A key UX consideration I had to make with my unusual nav bar was to allow mobile and tablet users to be able to just click on a button, without having to move the yellow stylus -- otherwise it would have been a nightmare to navigate.</p><img src="images/performance-snapshot.jpg" alt="Chrome Canary DevTools snapshot"/><h3>Development</h3><p>As there were a lot of elements to track with JavaScript, it was vital for me to use functional programming to keep my logic modular, and avoid repetition. I ended up using much less lines of code than I otherwise would have. Being a small site, this is not as big a problem, but I still wanted to be resourceful.</p><p>For the CSS, I used the GPS naming convention as it encourages using CSS in a cascading manner. As I had been using cascading style rules from the beginning, I found it much easier to pick-up GPS and begin developing fluidly. Having used this for both client and personal projects, I have spent a slither of time debugging CSS issues, with a much smaller CSS bundle size. Using this convention forced me to consider the design architecture of the site I am building far more, so that I can easily maintain the styles in the future. There were far less instances of breaking styles altogether because of specificity issues deriving from using classes for everything.</p><img src="images/portfolio-site-psi.PNG" alt="portfolio site 99"/></div></section><section id="more-portfolio-pieces" class="g-section-module"><h3>More Portfolio Pieces</h3><section id="s-portfolio"><div id="portfolio-blocks" class="g-grid"><a href="/punchline-punjabi.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="7ae3161a53964e343709.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Punchline Punjabi</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO; Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/portfolio-site.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="fce766bcbfda4a1f7fd5.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Portfolio Website</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/britasiatv.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx g-brown"><img src="images/britasia.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>BritAsia TV</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO.</p></div></div></a><a href="/bioprocessing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Affiliate Marketing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/bioprocessing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Bioprocessing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a></div></section></section></div></body></html>
