Being more into English music, this site was a great opportunity for me to explore the music of my native country. Within 2 months, the site was getting purely organic traffic (no external promotion, or paid traffic) to the amount of 50,000. At closing point, it reached 70,000 hits with good engagement. On top of this, it was also received well by the CEOs of established and respected South Asian organisations such as BritAsia TV, and BizAsia.</p><p>In this project, I wanted to experience the whole lifecycle of a web project: from the wireframing phase, to development & launch. I was able to get a fundamental understanding of UX, front-end coding, and SEO.</p></div><div id="portfolio-main-content"><img src="images/hundalenemies.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Design</h3><p>For the design, I wanted to create an enjoyable experience for visitors. I felt unhappy with other websites in this niche as they were bland and boring to navigate through. Punchline Punjabi's design needed to be bold and exciting, and so it went through many iterations in Figma.</p><p>I believe the best measure for the success of the design would be the positive reaction I received from the community about how much they liked the site.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Being my first proper web build, I initially built it using vanilla languages. But I had also built it a second time in Webflow so that I could take advantage of a CMS. Both iterations were useful in my education for different reasons: vanilla helped me gain practical experience in coding features such as an animated marquee, slider, and dynamic nav bar from scratch; whereas, Webflow and the presence of a CMS made me consider the UX of my design much more carefully.</p><p>In the time since, I've gone back and implemented Vue into the vanilla build, as this was much more efficient due to route-creation, rather than having separate static files for each page on the site. While implementing Vue, I had to overcome many technical SEO issues that are rife with SPAs, which I documented in the GitHub repository. If I were to set the project live in the future, I would integrate Nuxt due to its SEO advantages over Vue.</p><h3>SEO</h3><p>Building a new site completely from scratch was naturally going to provide plenty of challenges in getting visibility; this ranged from getting irrelevant traffic (in terms of target audience), to indexing problems, and gaining conversions.</p><p>One of the key lessons I learned, was that traffic in itself is not valuable. From an SEO standpoint, it can certainly be argued that traffic leads to higher visibility, and can bolster a site's search engine authority if supplementary metrics such as bounce rates and average session durations are decent. But in terms of real business value, if there are poor conversions then that increased visibility is useless.</p><p>With content sites, this issue is at its most prevalent, because there is no real product to convert users to. While information has much lower overhead, it is also incredibly difficult to convert with due to its abundance. I found this out first-hand when I began getting traffic from regions such as India, Russia, China, and so on -- all of which were not my target audience of second-generation Punjabi immigrants in Western countries. The impact on my site analytics was that the conversions dropped drastically, and my average session duration decreased and bounce rates increased. It was happening because this traffic simply wanted to find out more about songs they didn't understand due to language barriers. To resolve this, I used my site analytics to figure out which artists were popular in which regions; as I had started to branch out into more international artists, my traffic began spraying.</p><p>While it was nice to see my site ranking very well and people using my very first hand-built site, I firmly believe that I can deliver more real value in my next project, Push Product Punjab, which seeks to be a hub for Punjabi organisations. The lessons I learned from Punchline Punjabi have conditioned in traversing search engines to get conversions and I will be applying this to all of my future projects.</p></div></section><section id="more-portfolio-pieces" class="g-section-module"><h3>More Portfolio Pieces</h3><section id="s-portfolio"><div id="portfolio-blocks" class="g-grid"><a href="/punchline-punjabi.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="7ae3161a53964e343709.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Punchline Punjabi</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO; Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/portfolio-site.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="fce766bcbfda4a1f7fd5.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Portfolio Website</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/britasiatv.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx g-brown"><img src="images/britasia.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>BritAsia TV</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO.</p></div></div></a></div></section></section></div></body></html>
