          <h3>Brief</h3>
          <p>[redacted] is a large international organisation, specialising in affiliate marketing.</p>
          <p>
            For [redacted], I have completed detailed technical and on-page SEO audits, implemented custom WordPress
            functionality such as a large brand directory, set-up goal-tracking with Tag Manager and Analytics. I also
            did heavy-duty work on their page-speed by revising their code-base.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key achievement with this account was having the contract extended by an additional 6-months, because of
            our work.

        <div id="portfolio-main-content" class="g-flex-column">
          <h3>Large Directory Migration</h3>
          <p>
            The problem was that [redacted] had a large brand directory that was being hosted on another domain. From
            the initial audit I had completed, I had pointed out that there were a lot of keywords that the main domain
            could be ranking for, but was not. To resolve this, I migrated the old brand directory to the main domain,
            which is using WordPress CMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we had limited time to deliver results, I elected to use Node JS to scrape all the content from each
            brand directory page, format it into JSON and then into CSV, and import the data into WordPress using ACF
            PRO and WP All Import. To do so, I had to properly create ACF fields, and make sure that the scraped data
            can easily be allocated to each custom field.
          </p>
          <p>
            One challenge I encountered was making sure that the repeater lists I had set-up could easily parse through
            an array of strings into separate fields within the repeater. This was resolved through comma-delimiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge was that the old directory pages use Bootstrap, as well as non-unique classes. This raised
            an issue with reliably fetching the information on each page, and so I had to access them precisely using
            JavaScript. Often times, this required iterating over arrays, for which I used methods. I was able to
            reliably fetch all on-page information for 600+ pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of this, I also had to create a brand directory archive page, which could collate all the brands with
            pagination included. The main domain is using Bootstrap, and so I made sure to use this for visual
            consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I was working on a local environment, I wrote clear and precise instructions which allowed the [redacted]
            developers to successfully replicate the results on the live environment.
          </p>
          <h3>Conditional Redirects</h3>
          <p>
            Once the directory migration was complete, I needed to set-up conditional redirects from the old affiliate
            URLs, to the new ones. This required writing a custom function that used regex, SQL queries, object
            iteration, and conditional statements to make the redirects work for the specific use-case we had.
