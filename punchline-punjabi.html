Within 2 months, the site was getting purely organic traffic (no external promotion, or paid traffic) to the amount of 50,000. At closing point, it reached 70,000 average hits. On top of this, it was also received well by the CEOs of established and respected South Asian organisations such as BritAsia TV, and BizAsia.</p><p>In this project, I wanted to experience the whole lifecycle of a web project: from the wireframing phase, to development & launch. I was able to get a fundamental understanding of UX, front-end coding, and SEO.</p></div><div id="portfolio-main-content"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="f6353a47d548d5e68a1b.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Design</h3><p>For the design, I wanted to create an enjoyable experience for visitors. I felt unhappy with other websites in this niche as they were bland and boring to navigate through. Punchline Punjabi's design needed to be bold and exciting, and so it went through many iterations in Figma.</p><p>I believe the best measure for the success of the design would be the positive reaction I received from the community about how much they liked the site.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Being my first proper web build, I initially built it using vanilla languages. But I had also built it a second time in Webflow so that I could take advantage of a CMS. Both iterations were useful in my education for different reasons: Vanilla helped me gain practical experience in coding features such as an animated marquee, slider, and dynamic nav bar from scratch; whereas, Webflow and the presence of a CMS made me consider the UX of my design much more carefully.</p><p>In the time since, I've gone back and implemented Vue into the vanilla build, as this was much more efficient due to route-creation, rather than having separate static files for each page on the site. While implementing Vue, I had to overcome many technical SEO issues that are rife with SPAs, which I documented in the GitHub repository. If I were to set the project live in the future, I would integrate Nuxt due to its SEO advantages over Vue.</p><h3>Launch & SEO</h3><p>Building a new site completely from scratch was naturally going to provide plenty of challenges in getting visibility; this ranged from getting irrelevant traffic (in terms of target audience), to indexing problems, and gaining conversions.</p><p>The largest SEO challenge was taking the top spot for some highly competitive terms. At the beginning, my content was focused on Western Punjabi artists, and I was able to establish my site as the authority on these search terms. Later, I decided to go for the ultra-competitive artists such as Diljit Dosanjh, whom were already being covered by giant sites such as LyricsRaag.com, and Genius.com with years of SEO authority behind them. I was able to leverage exclusivity of information, internal traffic, and timing to get my posts covering Dosanjh's latest album into the top spots.</p><p>Internal traffic in particular was a massive help for getting my posts indexed quickly by Google, despite having little to no backlinks, and being under 6-months old (new, small sites tend to get sandboxed, and so it is typically a year or more before a site really begins to get traction). Because I had established my site as a source of quality information, it had gained a loyal group of returning visitors that meant my posts would instantly get views -- before they were even on Google; this then encouraged Google to index my articles within a day (when I started the website this period was 2-weeks). Without these return visitors, I never would have gotten so much traction within only 2-months.</p><p>I had also spent a lot of time optimising my site's technical SEO, but I cannot confirm the extent to which this helped my site rank in the long-run. In the short-run, I definitely noticed a ranking boost when I used dynamically generated Schema that was more detailed than my competitors' Schema (which was typically WordPress-generated), optimised my page speed to be above 90, and took care of all the other standard SEO implementations. Such things are much easier to observe with a new site, where there are fewer variables affecting a site's ranking.</p><p>Another pain-point was getting traffic from regions such as India, Russia, China, and so on -- all of which were not my target audience of second-generation Punjabi immigrants in Western countries. The impact on my site analytics was that the conversions dropped drastically, and my average session duration decreased and bounce rates increased. It was happening because this traffic simply wanted to find out more about songs they didn't understand due to language barriers. To resolve this, I used my site analytics to figure out which artists were popular in which regions; as I had started to branch out into more international artists, my traffic began spraying.</p><p>While it was nice to see my site ranking very well and tens of thousands of people using my very first website, I decided to close the site in its strongest month yet, since I felt I had learned everything I wanted to learn.</p></div></section><section id="more-portfolio-pieces" class="g-section-module"><h3>More Portfolio Pieces</h3><section id="s-portfolio"><div id="portfolio-blocks" class="g-grid"><a href="/punchline-punjabi.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="7ae3161a53964e343709.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Punchline Punjabi</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO; Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/portfolio-site.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="fce766bcbfda4a1f7fd5.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Portfolio Website</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/britasiatv.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx g-brown"><img src="images/britasia.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>BritAsia TV</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO.</p></div></div></a><a href="/affiliate-marketing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>Affiliate Marketing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/bioprocessing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>Bioprocessing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a></div></section></section></div></body></html>
