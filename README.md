# arjenportfolioredux
For this project I wanted to create a portfolio that was inspired by Chrome DevTools in some way: this culminated in a custom nav bar with a hover-scroll feature that took design elements from the DevTools Performance tab. While I used a lot more CSS and JS animations than I usually do, I made sure to make my functions and styles reusable to prevent repetition and bloated code. 

Further, this portfolio website ended up becoming a single-page design composed of multiple modules that gave the appearance of multiple pages; this tied very nicely with the hover-scroll nav bar, resulting in a fluid UX when going page-to-page. 

Naming convention: GPS.
Build tool: Webpack.
