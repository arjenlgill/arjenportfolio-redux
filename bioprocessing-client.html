This required a lot of careful thought into how I should rewrite all of the sections from the previous site, and being extremely resourceful with my code.</p><p>For the website rebuild, I achieved a 95% decrease in gzipped JavaScript size (going from 109kb to 4.4kb), an 84% decrease in main CSS file (going from 31kb to 4.96kb), and an increase in Page Speed Insights score from 10 (on the old site), to 90+.</p><p>To keep the page-speed optimised, I made my build completely modular, was sparse with libraries, and focused on Core Web Vitals metrics.</p></div><div id="portfolio-main-content" class="g-flex-column"><h3>Process</h3><h4>Keeping things modular</h4><p>One of the main ways I was able to reduce the size of my code-base was by adopting a modern build process that allowed me to make my code modular so that I didn’t need to repeat code for similar sections. I was able to develop a WordPress site that was composed of individual modules that could be used anywhere; this removed the need to repeat lots of styles as I only really needed to write within the context of the module as an individual component. On top of this, I also created different routes for each section of the site, to reduce the overall size of assets such as JS being served.</p><h4>Following a CSS naming system</h4><p>A CSS naming system led me to write the style rules of the new [redacted] site in a way that was as DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) as possible. I had opted for a naming system (GPS) that encouraged using CSS how it is meant to be used – in a cascading manner. By doing so, I was able to define global styles, and then tweak them in individual sections where the selector specificity was higher; this saved me from having to repeat a lot of styles and was vital in keeping the CSS ~4kb. As I had created separate routes for the homepage and non-homepage sections, I was also able to code-split my CSS, which was much easier as I already had clearly-defined sections for global and non-global styles – eliminating the need to sift through lots of style rules without breaking anything. My CSS was written in a modular way, and so I didn’t need to worry about such things.</p><h4>Being sparse with libraries</h4><p>A major pain-point of the old site was the amount of heavy libraries it was using, so I was determined to keep this to a minimum. Often, the trade-off of a convenient library is not worth the cost on page-loading speeds, as typically you will only need a fraction of the entire library. In some cases, it is entirely possible to manually cut out bits you don’t need (such as with Bootstrap, which I used for some minor components), but if you are importing a library externally, then it is not as simple. There are also potential issues with maintainability that I wanted to avoid; therefore, vanilla was my preferred option for most components of the site, and it has had a clear impact on performance (results included further down).</p><h4>Reducing layout shifts</h4><p>With the Core Web Vitals update, UX metrics such as layout shifts have now entered the mix (albeit this was already influential in page rankings as it has a correlation with bounce rates), and so satisfying visitors’ needs without irritating them is even more important. I made sure to keep the cumulative layout shift score at 0 by employing new best practices such as specifying height and width, while still keeping images and containers responsive. This added another challenge to the build process, but I believe that the end-result of a more enjoyable user-experience is worth it.</p></div></section><section id="more-portfolio-pieces" class="g-section-module"><h3>More Portfolio Pieces</h3><section id="s-portfolio"><div id="portfolio-blocks" class="g-grid"><a href="/autotechnik.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/autotechnik-image.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>AutoTechnik</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/somfy.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/somfy-image 1.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>Somfy</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/punchline-punjabi.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="7ae3161a53964e343709.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Punchline Punjabi</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO; Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/portfolio-site.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src="fce766bcbfda4a1f7fd5.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3>Portfolio Website</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/britasiatv.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx g-brown"><img src="images/britasia.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="300"/><h3>BritAsia TV</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>SEO.</p></div></div></a><a href="/affiliate-marketing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Affiliate Marketing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a><a href="/bioprocessing-client.html"><div class="portfolio-block g-hoverfx"><img src="images/confidential.jpg" alt=""/><h3>Bioprocessing Client</h3><div class="g-fields"><p>Web Dev.</p></div></div></a></div></section></section></div></body></html>
